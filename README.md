# BC_MagellanLeftLook
calculating BC for Magellan Left Look Data

Code for creating a backscatter coefficient raster (uncorrected for latitudinal effects) from the Magellan Left Look SAR Mosaic. 
Important: the SAR mosaic needs to be in an equirectangular cylindrical projection so that the same number of pixels are in each half degree of latitude.
