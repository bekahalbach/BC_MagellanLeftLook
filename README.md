# BC_MagellanLeftLook
calculating BC for Magellan Left Look Data

Code for creating a backscatter coefficient raster (uncorrected for latitudinal effects) from the Magellan Left Look SAR Mosaic. 
Important: the SAR mosaic needs to be in an equirectangular cylindrical projection so that the same number of pixels are in each half degree of latitude. 

The backscatter coefficient equation comes from the Magellan Quantitative Image Interpretation Guide by BA Campbell (https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/1995/0519/report.pdf).
